<ol> 
  <li>Implementation of two signals using Circular Convolution</li>
  <li>Plotting two given signals and calculating summation and subtraction of the signal.
n1 = [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2] and n2 = [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3] </li>
  <li>Drawing the given signals in one figure</li>
</ol>

### Theory:
In the experiment, we worked with discrete signals. A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, where the integer index can be thought of as a time index, and the values in the sequence represent some physical quantity of interest.
Circular convolution, also known as cyclic convolution, is a special case of periodic convolution, which is the convolution of two periodic functions that have the same period. Circular convolution is defined for periodic sequences, whereas convolution is defined for aperiodic sequences. The circular convolution of two N-point periodic sequences x(n) and y(n) is the N-point sequence a(m) = x(n)* y(n), defined by.
