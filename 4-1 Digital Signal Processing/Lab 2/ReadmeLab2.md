### Experiment No: 03
### Experiment Date: 08.05.2023
### Experiment Name: 
Study and implementation of cross correlation and auto correlation using xcorr function and also without function.

### Theory:
In the experiment, we worked with correlation and autocorrelation of signals. A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, where the integer index can be thought of as a time index, and the values in the sequence represent some physical quantity of interest.
Autocorrelation is the correlation of a time series and its lagged version over time. Although similar to correlation, autocorrelation uses the same time series twice. Financial analysts and traders use autocorrelation to examine historical price movements and predict future ones. Cross-correlation is a measurement that tracks the movements of two or more sets of time series data relative to one another. It is used to compare multiple time series and objectively determine how well they match up with each other and, in particular, at what point the best match occurs
