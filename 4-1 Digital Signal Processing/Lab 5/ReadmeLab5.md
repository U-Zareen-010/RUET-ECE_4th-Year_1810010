### Experiment Name: 
Study and implementation of finding the Z-transform and inverse Z-transform of a function.

### Theory:

####Z Transform:
The Z-Transform is a powerful technique for transforming discrete-time signals into the complex frequency domain. It's particularly useful for analyzing the stability, transient response, and frequency 
characteristics of discrete systems. The general formula for the Z-Transform of a sequence x[n] is given by:

Here, X(z) is the Z-Transform of the sequence x[n], and z is a complex variable.

#### Inverse Z Transform:
The Inverse Z-Transform is the counterpart to the Z-Transform. It allows us to recover the original discrete signal from its Z-Domain representation. The Inverse Z-Transform is crucial for practical 
implementations, as it enables us to translate theoretical frequency domain analysis into actual time-domain signals. The general formula for the Inverse Z-Transform is:

Here, x[n] represents the original discrete signal, X(z) is its Z-Transform, and j is the imaginary unit. The integral contour wraps around the region of convergence (ROC) of the Z-Transform.
