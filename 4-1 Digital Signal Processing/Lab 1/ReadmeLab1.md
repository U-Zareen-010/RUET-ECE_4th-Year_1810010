### Experiment No: 01

### Experiment Date: 19.03.2023

### Experiment Name: 
Implementation of convolution of two signals,
    a) using Conv. Function
    b) without using Conv. Function

### Theory:
In the experiment, we worked with continuous and discrete signals. A signal that varies smoothly and continuously over time is referred to as a continuous-time signal. These signals represent a quantity of interest that is influenced by an independent variable, usually considered as time. A discrete-time signal is a sequence of values of interest, where the integer index can be thought of as a time index, and the values in the sequence represent some physical quantity of interest.
The Conv. function converts a number from one numeric base system to another, and returns the result as a string value. The convolution of two vectors, u and v, represents the area of overlap under the points as v slides across u. Algebraically, convolution is the same operation as multiplying polynomials whose coefficients are the elements of u and v.
